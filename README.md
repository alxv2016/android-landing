# Android 11 landing page
A redesign of google's Android 11 landing page build from the ground up using gsap animation library and vanilla javascript. This was an exercise in learning how to setup a webpack project and to animate scroll base animations with gsap's scrollTrigger plugin.

## Libraries used
To keep it lean only a handful of external libraries were used
1. gsap - [gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
2. splidejs - [splidejs](https://splidejs.com/)

## Dev and Build scripts
```
npm run serve
```
```
npm run build
```
